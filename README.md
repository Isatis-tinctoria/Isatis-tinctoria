👋 Hi there! I'm Isatis-tinctoria, a code wizard by day and a caffeine-powered dreamer by night.

🌌 Exploring the digital cosmos, one line of code at a time. Currently hacking away on [How not to write code, and have money to spend] with a sprinkle of creativity and a dash of humor.

🚀 Turning coffee into code since 2018 year! If it compiles, ship it; if it crashes, make it pretty.

💡 Passionate about innovation, open source, and the occasional meme. My commits might be serious, but my commit messages certainly aren't.

🎮 When I'm not chasing semicolons, you'll find me pursue all new things.

📬 Slide into my DMs like 😎 - let's chat about code, cats, and the meaning of life.

🌟 Thanks for dropping by the coding carnival! Grab a virtual snack 🍕 and let's craft some byte-sized brilliance together!
